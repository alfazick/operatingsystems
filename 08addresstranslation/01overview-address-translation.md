# Hardware-Based Address Translation

## Core Concept
Address translation is a hardware-based technique that extends limited direct execution for memory virtualization. The hardware transforms every memory access from virtual addresses (used by applications) to physical addresses (actual memory locations).

## How It Works
* Hardware transforms each memory access:
  - Instruction fetches
  - Load operations
  - Store operations
* Every memory reference undergoes address translation
* Virtual addresses â†’ Physical addresses

## Hardware-OS Partnership
### Hardware Role
* Performs the actual translation efficiently
* Handles translation on every memory access
* Provides low-level mechanism for redirection

### OS Role
* Sets up hardware translation mechanisms
* Manages memory allocation
* Tracks free and used memory locations
* Intervenes when necessary to maintain control

## The Illusion Created
* Programs appear to have their own private memory
* Each program sees its own virtual memory space
* Code and data seem to exist in this private space

## Physical Reality
* Multiple programs share physical memory simultaneously
* CPU switches between programs
* Physical memory is shared resource managed by OS

## Goal
Transform the complex physical reality of shared memory into a simple abstraction where each program believes it has its own private memory space.
